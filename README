System requirements
====================

Boost >= 1.51.0 with program_options and boost_mpi compiled in.
GNU Scientific Library >= 1.15

Compiling
=========

InFER-ausei is built using GNU Autotools.  The process is as follows:

$ tar zxvf infer-ausei-4.0.tar.gz
$ cd infer-ausei-4.0
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Non-standard library locations
==============================

To point the build process at non-standard library locations
(e.g. for GSL and Boost), use the CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment
variables.  For example:

$ ./configure CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/packages/gsl-1.15/include -I/usr/local/packages/boost_1_51_0/include" \
          LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/packages/gsl-1.15/lib -L/usr/local/packages/boost_1_51_0/lib"


Running infer-ausei
===================

InFER-ausei provides the "auseiMcmc" binary which will be installed into "prefix" (see ./configure --help).  This 
binary provides some command line switches:

$ auseiMcmc --help
infer-ausei 4.0 (c) 2014 Chris Jewell <chrism0dwk@gmail.com>

Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]                display help message
  -c [ --config ] arg          xml config file (required)
  -n [ --niter ] arg (=10000)  number of iterations
  -s [ --seed ] arg (=0)       random seed
  -o [ --output ] arg (=ausei) output file prefix
  
The main configuration is set by using
