#' Using the model of Jewell and Brown, JRS Interface, 2015, this package
#' performs inference on and simulates outbreaks of vector borne diseases
#' where knowledge of the vector population is sparse.  Specifically, this
#' model and associated algorithms were designed for analysis of the 2012
#' outbreak of Theileria orientalis (Ikeda) in New Zealand.
